# ScrollToDeath

## ScrollToDeath is a browser extension designed to fight procrastination. It allows the user to track how long they browse any website. Upon reaching a time limit set by the user, the extension starts applying nudges that become bolder as the user continues to browse tracked websites. These can be changing keywords related to time and procrastination with the intention to remind the user that they are procrastinating, changing some images in the current website related to procrastination and time wasting, periodically trying to close the unproductive tabs that are open and finally force close them.
